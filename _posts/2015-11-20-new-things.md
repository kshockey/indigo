For those of you who didn't hear already, I accepted a position as a Resource Description Specialist at ["The" American University Libraries](http://www.american.edu/library/) in Washington, DC. I am so excited to start this new chapter of my life in an exciting new place. I'm currently in DC hunting for apartments, but in December I'll be honest to god employed. How about that? More writing will come soon but I am pretty occupied at the moment with this move. See you soon, Atlantic seaboard.
