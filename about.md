<p align="justify">Hi! I'm Kyle and you are reading this website with your eyeballs. During the day I make music metadata for <a href="https://www.loc.gov/" target="_blank">The Library of Congress</a>. Other times I am learning 日本語 and the bass guitar, swimming, reading, or playing some kind of game. What you'll find here is mostly a laboratory for shorter form writing, likely on musical topics surrounding the video game music scene, as well as Japanese and American popular music. I'm rebooting this website from scratch, so more features might be in store, depending on future projects. Thanks for coming!</p>
